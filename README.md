# MovieDataViz-R
This project analyzes domestic box office performance using R. It visualizes movie genres (Action, Adventure, Animation, Comedy, Drama), budgets (bubble size), and studios (color-coded) with a boxplot. Created as part of my R programming learning journey, showcasing data visualization techniques.
